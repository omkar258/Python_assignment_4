# # ASSIGNMENT 4: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

## Overview

This repository contains the Python scripts for **Assignment 4**, focusing on file handling, exception management, and error handling as covered in **Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python**.

The assignment is divided into two tasks:
1.  **Task 1** addresses reading from a file and gracefully handling `File Not Found` errors.
2.  **Task 2** addresses writing data to a file, appending additional content, and finally reading and displaying the complete contents.

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:
1.  Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.
2.  Prints its content line by line.
3.  Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist (e.g., using a `try-except` block).

### Expected Output

*   **If the file exists:** Prints the content of `sample.txt`.
*   **If the file does not exist:** Prints a user-friendly error message indicating the file was not found.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

### Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:
1.  Takes user input (e.g., a number or string) and writes it to a new file named `output.txt`.
2.  Appends additional data (e.g., a predefined string or another user input) to the same file.
3.  Reads and displays the final content of the `output.txt` file.

### Expected Output

The program should display the combined content (initial write + appended data) of `output.txt`.
The final content of output.txt is:

25

This is the appended data.
*(Note: The exact output will depend on the appended data used in the script.)*
